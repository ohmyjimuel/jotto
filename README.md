This game is based on Wordle, an online web-based game, created by Josh Wardle. It is a guessing game for 5-letter words, with 6 guesses, that resets daily for its online website. 

Mechanics:
<br> •	Players have varying number of attempts to guess an n-letter word. The number of attempts and the word length will be based on the difficulty chosen by the player.
<br> •	A feedback will be given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
<br> •	If the letter is in the right position, the tile will show the letter, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong position, the tile will show the ? symbol, otherwise, the tile will show the * symbol.
