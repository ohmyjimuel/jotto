This game is based on Wordle, an online web-based game, created by Josh Wardle. It is a guessing game for 5-letter words, with 6 guesses, that resets daily for its online website. 

Mechanics:
<br> •	Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word.
<br> •	A feedback will be given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position.
<br> •	If the letter is in the right position, the tile will turn green, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong position, the tile will turn yellow, otherwise, the tile won’t have any color.
